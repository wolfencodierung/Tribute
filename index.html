<div class="main-text">	
	<p>The Superlite SL-C was designed and engineered by a small group of dedicated engineers, designers and craftsmen. It never passed through a committee, and we didn’t make any Powerpoints while it was in the process of creation. That’s because we only needed to answer to our own vision of what the perfect Supercar would be. And that is why the Superlite SL-C is so pure in line. And so technologically advanced.</p>
	<p>It has Class-A finishes on every panel so you don’t even need to paint it- you can buff the gelcoat and go. Or use a vinyl wrap if you want. The doors fit right out of the mold, and don’t need weeks of trimming and fettling to attach properly to the body.</p>
	<p>The chassis doesn’t have sloppy MIG welds with spatter everywhere, and welds that need to be ground off to fit aluminum panels. The SL-C chassis is the stiffest on the market, with beautiful TIG welds, no spatter, and requires no more work to be done to it as delivered.</p>
	<p>The SL-C even has custom aluminum suspension arms and uprights that are CNC-machined in house, instead of re-using old parts from a car with a completely different engine/drive configuration. All SL-Cs have double-adjustable aluminum shocks that are race-derived, not fixed-rate shocks that are supposed to work for every situation and builder. The chassis and suspension parts are truly designed to work together, so you have proper camber and bump-steer curves, and more than enough caster.</p>

	<p class="emphasis-text"><em>The Superlite Coupe has a modern chassis with a proper suspension, and a great-looking body with superb fit and finish. Is it as fast as it looks- or is it something that just looks racy?</em></p>
   </div>
	<p>We didn’t just win a few races, we set lap records at every track we visited on the way to winning the 2011 NASA Super Unlimited class National Championship. We dominated at the National Championships, capturing pole position for every race, winning both qualifying races, and almost lapping the entire class in the final National Championship race.</p>
	
  <p>"For most replicar home builders, the SL-C could possibly be best described as a supercar, with its sights set on the performance of say a Saleen S7. That’s a heady statement for a company with a toe in the kit car market, but Hall believes he has to think out of the box in order to offer home builders a product they’ll be extremely happy with."</p>

	<h3>Highlights</h3>
 	<p>The SL-C was designed from the beginning with the idea that the owner/builder knew best about what drivetrain to use. So the engine bay was designed to be as long and wide as possible, to accommodate an incredibly wide range of engines in the car.</p>
   <p>Any modern V8 engine will fit just fine, including the popular GM LS-series of V8 engines, as they are lightweight, easily available, have a large aftermarket presence, and are relatively inexpensive for their power output. Other engine such as the new Ford mod motors (and the new 5.0 liter Coyote, which shares a similar architecture) and the late Chrysler Hemis, many Japanese engines, including the popular Lexus V8s, and even Porsche V8s and flat sixes will fit just fine.</p>  
  <img class="text-img-right" src="http://www.gt40s.com/forum/attachment.php?attachmentid=48237&d=1280838895" alt="Rough Sketch of the SL-C Spaceframe Chassis and V10 Powerplant"></img>  
	<p>The SL-C is an extraordinarily fast car. With the popular GM LS7 engine, a Ricardo gearbox, Hoosier R6 tires, and an interior, we timed an SL-C at 10.4 in the ¼ mile at 132 MPH. It’s not really a drag car, but an experienced driver, and better setup could no doubt improve on that time. 0-to-60 numbers are in the 3.2 second range, depending on conditions.  Top speed is a function of setup and drivetrain, but with enough power, and the right gearing, the car could easily do well over 200 MPH.  The Ricardo transaxle is geared quite tall, with a theoretical top speed of about 257 MPH, assuming the engine had the power to pull it.</p>
	<p>One of the great features of the Superlite SL-C is that it has a very open and airy cabin. Forward visibility is excellent, due to the wide and curving windshield that gives a panoramic view of what is ahead. It’s even easy to see stoplights.  Wide, spacious windows give good side visibility as well.</p>
	<p>We have tried to make the SL-C as safe as reasonably possible.  One way is through active means: the SL-C is agile enough to get out of dangerous circumstances, so it can avoid them entirely, instead of just plowing into them. Really great brakes that were originally designed for much heavier cars help to slow the SL-C much more efficiently than regular cars, so there is a safety margin there as well.</p>
  <h3>Street Legal</h3>
	<p>there are already many SL-Cs already on the road with no problems in many US states. The street kits have USA and European legal DOT-approved glass windshields, DOT and E-marked headlights, and DOT-approved taillights.</p>
	<p>SL-Cs are also available in Canada, and can be shipped from Ontario, so there are no import problems.  Several are already registered and running in Canada. There are SL-Cs licensed and registered on the road in other countries as well.  Contact us about your country if you are interested in a street version.</p>
  <h3>Interior Space</h3>
	<p>We’ve fit people who were 6’ 5”” and taller in the car. Because there is tremendous room in the footwells, very long-legged driver (and passengers) can be accommodated with ease. Drivers who are tall in the trunk will usually need to sit a bit more reclined, but pretty much everyone can fit.  We even have an optional “Gentlemen’s” seat that is 2” wider than the standard seat. There is even an adjustable pedals option, to make the car very adjustable for every driver.  With seats on inexpensive sliders, and the standard electric tilt and telescope steering wheels, there’s a way to fit just about everyone.</p>
	<h3>Safety</h3>
	<p>The SL-C also has passive safety built in as well.  For example, the fuel tank is located in the safest position possible- between very strong chassis members, in the middle of the car (instead of being at the front or rear of the car where it is more likely to be ruptured in an accident.  Driver and passenger sit well inside the car, much closer to the centerline to provide additional safety (compared to other cars that have the occupants’ bodies very close to the outside edge of the car).</p>

	<p>The car also comes with a 6-point “roof structure” (the lawyers don’t want us to call it a roll cage) that serves to add chassis stiffness and provide some protection in the event of a rollover. For track use, available door bars provide more side-intrusion protection, and can be fitted to street cars as well.</p>
	<p>All versions of the SL-C share the same very strong aluminum hybrid monocoque chassis that has been tested in computer simulations to be extremely rigid.  In addition, the SL-C has passed the extremely stringent Austrailian ADR requirements for chassis stiffness, with ease.  It's very strong.</p>
	<p>Race versions of the SL-C have an incredibly strong race cage that is designed to meet FIA, NASA and SCCA regulations. Fuel is contained in a series-legal fuel cell.  Use of proper racing gear like a HANS, correctly installed and used safety belts and helmets help to make the SL-C a very safe race car indeed.</p>

<p class="emphasis-text"><em>The Superlite SL-C has great looks, a modern chassis, and now, a racing history. It’s a beautiful thing.</em></p>

<p>No vehicle of any kind is risk free to operate. But we have tried to make the SL-C as safe as reasonably possible.  One way is through active means: the SL-C is agile enough to get out of dangerous circumstances, so it can avoid them entirely, instead of just plowing into them. Really great brakes that were originally designed for much heavier cars help to slow the SL-C much more efficiently than regular cars, so there is a safety margin there as well.</p>

	<h3>Building process</h3>
	<p>The Superlite SL-C was designed to be built in your garage, using basic hand tools.  You don’t need to do any welding, or machining, or have fancy tools. Experienced builders have built complete cars with paint, a luxurious interior, and the popular LS-series of Chevrolet engines in less than 220 hours. If it’s your first build, or you are adding a lot of custom features, it will almost certainly take longer, but the SL-C is probably the fastest car to build, and the easiest and least expensive to build to a high standard, than any other similar-looking car. Building a track car is even easier, as there is a minimal interior, and will often be the least expensive option. These can realistically be built in as little as 200 hours.</p>
